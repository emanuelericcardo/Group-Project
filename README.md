Group Project for second semester M1. Topic: 3D reconstruction of Small Objects by Photogrammetry

The contribution of this study is twofold. 

First, we provide a systematic review of techniques currently used for 3D reconstruction, which are split in three categories: approaches based on Shape-from-Silhouette, on Structure from Motion and on Deep learning. 

Then, we analyze the performances of currently available 3D reconstruction frameworks. 
Our results indicate that 3DF Zephyr represents a valid trade-off between the considered metrics, despite the small number of reconstructed points.
